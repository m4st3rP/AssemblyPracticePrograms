# AssemblyPracticePrograms
Some programs I did as practice in ARMv7-M Assembly. They are in german though.

Bitcompare in ShiftAndRotate(316).asm sets r2 to 0 if Bit 0 and Bit 7 of r1 are equal and to 1 if they are not.
RotateL5 in ShiftAndRotate(316).asm shifts Bit 0 to 4 in r0 one digit to the left while not touching bit 5 to 31.

aCounter(289).asm counts how many "a" a String that ends with 0 has and saves the amount to r0.
